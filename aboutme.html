                    <p class="text-center lead"> I am an Applied Computer Science Graduate that loves to code, and developed this amazing website about myself for the world to enjoy</p>
                    <p class="text-center lead">I recently completed a bootcamp and internship for a small start up business in Cape Town, South Africa called Bulukutu Tea.
                        I am currently doing another Bootcamp in data Analytics that involves learning about the language of python.
                        I participated in many academic projects creating mobile and web applications for multiple companies throughout my years of study.
                        My main focus is web developement as I am studying more and more to earn the title of Fullstack developer. 
                        This portfolio is only the beginning of many applications that I will build in the future to show my strong knowledge of programming.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center lead"> 
                        I am currently working towards another bootcamp completion, while practicing languages I do know.
                        I created many small projects that I successfully created myself, and currently shared within this portfolio that I am proud as they showcase my skills
                        in front-end development. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center lead"> 
                        Working with many developement teams through my academic projects and internship, it helped me learn and understand Azure DevOps, Github
                        and gain valuable leadership skills, Working with these platforms are nothing new to me.
